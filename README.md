Section A:

a) There are two images in the images array contained in the object. 

The overall image total, that is to say the number of images in the group which this object is addressing (probably the images which are listed as positive results to the search query,) is 39.  

b) jsonobject.images[0].users[1].name

c) Using the object in Appendix A - the code will return a null/undefined result as there is only 1 object in the users array

d) Since there's a totalImages property as well as an Offset property, it's clear that there are only 2 image objects in the image array because these are the two remaining images after skipping the first 37. Most likely this is the result of a user tabbing through multiple previous pages of images and being left with only the last two to view.
